# Implement a solution for following problem  

## Problem
You are given N fractions, numbered from 0 to N-1. Your task is to count the number of
occurrences of the fractions that appears most often.

Notive that two fractions may be equal even if they have different representations, for
3/5 example and 5/10 are equal.

You should not assume that floating point operations are precise.

Write a function:

``` java
class Solution {
public int solution(int[] X, int[] Y);
}
```

That given two arrays X and Y consisting of N integers each (which represent the K-th
fraction as X[K]/Y[K]) return the number of occurrences of the fraction that appears most
often.
